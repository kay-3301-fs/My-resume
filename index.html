<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Lebohang, and as I write this statement, I am 24 years old. I am a very hardworking individual
with a profound passion for technology that has been growing since I was 13 years old.
My love for technology is indescribable; it feels natural and effortless for me to engage with both hardware and software.
I have a unique ability to grasp new technological concepts quickly, often within less than an hour.</p>    

<p>My journey into web programming began in grade 10 when I was introduced to a subject called Computer Applications Technology
(CAT), which included a module on HTML. While many of my classmates found HTML challenging, I found it intuitive and engaging. 
My dedication and enthusiasm for the subject were reflected in my academic performance, consistently ranking among the top two 
achievers in my class.</p>

<p>I started learning coding in 2023 but had to quit due to financial constraints. However, my love for IT never waned. Despite
the setback, I returned to coding with even more determination and passion than before. This experience taught me resilience and
reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in technology.</p>

<p>My love for IT is evident in everything I do, and I am committed to leveraging my abilities to make meaningful contributions 
to the world of technology. I continuously strive to deepen my knowledge and skills, embracing every opportunity to learn and grow.
My aim is to one day be one of the smartest individuals in the IT field, understanding as many programming languages as possible. 
I aspire to excel not only in web development but also in other areas such as cybersecurity and the languages used in creating video games.</p>
